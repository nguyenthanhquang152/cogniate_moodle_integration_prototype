Verdict: PREPARATION READY — common/Blackboard only; product verification NOT RUN
Round: target-snapshot preparation, 2026-10-20
Owner: retained independent common/Blackboard QA
Dispatch: `task_7f4a69ad0b33` / `ctx_365b9228372d`

The requested test preparation is complete. This is not an acceptance PASS.
The source is the applied contract revision
`ccdd9ef67cdd2be4c6af374136777fda4e081943` and approved proposal D
`78bc34ac422e0bcac324fa10e69ec9f82a17a3b8`. No Author implementation, held
`redemption.test.ts`, Author audit note or reviewer report supplied an oracle.
Existing QA helpers, fixtures and simulator behavior were inspected for reuse.

## Prepared coverage

The extension adds 27 individually mandatory `SIM` rows:

- Blackboard 37: v2, v5, v7, v9, v11, v12, w, x1, x2, y1, y2, z1–z5.
- Blackboard 29: k1–k3.
- Blackboard 38: i3, i4.
- Common 38: h1–h5, i5.

The [acceptance plan](qa-plan.md#target-snapshot-preparation-2026-10-20)
maps these to public oracles and execution phases. Common plus Blackboard
now has 183 manifest rows: 166 API cases and 17 host rows. The h1–h5 host
probes have explicit discovery checks as well as individual result IDs.

`snapshot.ts` is the shared Canvas interface. Its pure oracle module is
independent of production validators. The no-attempt oracle requires a
connection-scoped cursor, one healthy process, and the refused request's
same-trace HTTP completion. Positive controls require exactly one committed
attempt event, including V failures. Gate counts include every received
method and path. Fresh Blackboard controls hold V and require the phase-1
event before delivery. A preflight before phase 1 cannot satisfy that control.
These observations do not replace the Author's injected transaction-rollback
tests.

Each full round requires four disjoint phases at the same candidate/test
SHAs: `sim`, `snapshot-isolated`, `snapshot-upgrade`, `migration`. Shared
platform deletion and replacement run only in the isolated phase. The
populated snapshot upgrade starts at
`9f96f7b24cd0aed702e4dc40373bdda4307aad31`, with 011 and no 012; seeds four
public fixture states; verifies a stopped backup before candidate startup;
and checks that the stopped ledger adds exactly 012. Old Canvas and Blackboard
keys are compared with new signed launches and used throughout recovery.
The original `b0b83a8` Moodle migration/rollback route is still separate and
required in both rounds. No fixture writes SQL or edits a migration ledger.

## Preparation checks

Commands run on the working QA tree, without Docker or product execution:

```sh
node tests/host/run-m1.mjs --harness-only --provider blackboard
npm --prefix tests run typecheck
node --check tests/host/run-m1.mjs
node --check tests/host/m1-migration.mjs
git diff --check -- tests docs/reviews/M1/qa-plan.md docs/reviews/M1/qa.md docs/reviews/M3/qa.md
```

The owned harness check passed: 27 self-checks; type checking; 166 API cases
discovered; 17 host rows accounted for; and both snapshot probe stages
discovered exactly. The self-checks reject hidden GETs and other methods,
an attempt after completion, a restart inside an audit window, a missing
completion control, wrong backup contents, an already-012 baseline,
missing 011, duplicate results, skipped required cases and mixed evidence.

The full preparation command was also used as a negative inventory control:

```sh
node tests/host/run-m1.mjs --harness-only --provider all
```

It exited 1 at `Required canvas race variant missing: M1-37 v1`, after the
self-checks and typecheck passed. This is the expected hold, not a product
failure. Canvas still owes 37 v1/v3/v4/v6/v8/v10/v12/aa and 38 i1/i2/i4.
The common guard requires those exact rows; it cannot report a partial suite
as full readiness. Its v12/i4 must remain distinct from Blackboard's rows.

## Execution hold

No stack, migration, legacy acceptance, root product test or provider tenant
check ran. No product PASS, database migration result or interoperability
claim is made. No commit or push was made. Product/infra files, the held
Author test, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, Canvas-owned tests and browser files were
left untouched.

The Lead must integrate the Canvas rows, commit tests by path, freeze exact
40-character product and test SHAs, and reserve the one-stack lane before a
new execution dispatch. The full runner rejects dirty or untracked tests
under a frozen test SHA. Suggested lane: `qa-multi-r1`, port `8443`, subnet
`172.29.0.0/16`; one phase at a time within existing Docker limits. The plan
lists exact commands and resource estimates. No Docker Desktop setting
change is required.

Live 5-second schedules, CLI latency, host profile transitions, simulator
state across upgrade and maintenance backup encoding remain execution risks
until the later clean run. A missed deadline or incomplete capture is
`BLOCKED` and fails the gate. Real Canvas/Blackboard access is still unknown.
Metadata profiles and signed local simulations cannot supply live labels.
